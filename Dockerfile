 # lists it under devDependencies. That drags in @prisma/config, deepmerge-ts
 # and (on Prisma 7) mysql2 - roughly 120 MB of build tooling, plus their CVEs,
 # into a runtime image that never invokes the CLI.
 #
 # The runtime needs only @prisma/client plus the generated .prisma/client
 # (which embeds the query engine), so the CLI is removed explicitly.
